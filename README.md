Pure Documentation on how I did the internship project

GETTING AQUINTED WITH FIGMA
Created a Figma Account. Took some youtube tutorials on how figma works and started out.
I got to understand that I was using the cover mode to see the designs in figma. I switched from “Cover” to “Designs” on the left menu bar and was able to access the different layers.

EXPORTING THE IMAGES
I highlighted all the layouts in the design labelled “#1” and pasted it in a new environment where I created a new project. Same goes for other interested designs that I would want to work on.
Exporting the background image was a little problem but I later but I later figured it out. I had to set the other layouts to invisible, clicked the image. On the right hand side is a space given to export the highlighted image.
I did same similar thing to export most of useful images, svg and png.

USING CODE
Afterwards, I set up my react-app for the project and started coding.
I used bootstrap to achieve my styling. Added little bits of pure CSS for styling complicated tags

DEPLOYMENT
Using my github account, I created a different repository for this project.
And finally hosted using vercel
